# CPI
Bank employees /retirees in India are granted rise in inflation compensation (Dearness Allowance) on the basis ofAll India Consumer Price Index Nos(AICPIN) data, released by M/oLabour & Employment, every month. The index nos for March is published on last working day of the succededing month ie. on last working day  April. 
For  bank Pensioners the compensation is termed as Dearness relief(DR).
Increase or decrease in DA for employees  is based on quarterly average of last 3 months. For the quarterly average of Jan-March, the compensation or recovery , is made in May and so on every quarter,
The pensioners' DR is calculated  on the quartely average of last three months but  are paid twice a yeari.e for the half-year Jan to June they are paid in August; and for the half-year July to December they are paid on February. The calculations are made on the basis of quarterly average of last 3 monts of the half year.
Every time the data is released, employees and Pensioners are eager to know its effect on their take home pay/pension. This boring stuff is to continue throught their life.
In this calculator, an effort is made to provide the entire required information on the single click of the button.It may provide relief,especially pensioners who are at the advanced stage of their life, as they need not involve themselves in cumbersome calculations based on the release of the data.
thanks.
